TCS Stock Data - Live and Latest
---------------------------------------

👨‍💻 Project By: Anurag Dewangan
📅 Submission Date: 26/06/2025

🔍 Objective:
To analyze and predict TCS stock prices using Machine Learning (Linear Regression) and Deep Learning (LSTM).

📦 Tools & Libraries:
- Python 3.11
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- TensorFlow (LSTM model)

📁 Files Included:
1. tcs_stock_analysis.py - Linear Regression model with EDA and prediction
2. tcs_stock_lstm.py - LSTM deep learning model to predict next close price
3. TCS_stock_history.csv - Dataset used
4. TCS_Stock_Project_Presentation.pptx - presentation
5. README.txt - This file

📊 Graphs Included:
- TCS Close Price Over Time.png → TCS closing price over time
- Actual vs Predicted Close Price.png → Linear Regression predictions
- TCS Close Price  + LSTM Prediction.png → LSTM predicted price with trend line


📊 Project Summary:
- Dataset contains daily TCS stock prices from 2002 to 2024
- EDA includes time-series plots, volume trends, and moving averages
- Linear Regression Model:
   - R² Score: ~0.9999
   - Very high accuracy on test set
- LSTM Model:
   - Built using 60-day sequences of closing price
   - Predicted next closing price with high precision

✅ Outcome:
Successfully built both traditional and deep learning models to analyze and predict TCS stock trends.
