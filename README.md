### üìå Project Conclusion

The TCS stock has demonstrated a strong and steady growth trajectory over the past two decades, supported by solid fundamentals and market leadership in the IT services sector. Despite short-term fluctuations, the overall long-term trend is bullish, which aligns with the company's financial strength and global expansion.

Using both Linear Regression and LSTM, we successfully modeled the stock‚Äôs behavior, with the LSTM model effectively capturing temporal patterns for short-term forecasting. These models can be used to further analyze investor opportunities or develop real-time trading strategies.

This project not only reflects the technical capability of modern prediction models but also underlines the strength and stability of TCS as a key player in the Indian stock market.
